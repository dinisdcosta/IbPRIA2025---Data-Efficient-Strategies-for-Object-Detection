# IbPRIA2015 - Data-Efficient Strategies for Object Detection

Welcome to this hands-on tutorial presented at IbPRIA 2025. In this session, we walk through the full process of building a **custom object detection model** using YOLO, while demonstrating the power of **Transfer Learning (TL)**, **Active Learning (AL)**, and the **importance of data quality**.

Our example task: detecting **whitefly pests in tomato greenhouses** â€” a real-world scenario requiring accurate, efficient, and cost-effective detection.
